# transfer_Learning
This notebook explains basic information about Transfer Learning and pre-trained  Models, in addition to some examples

This notebook explains some important models, two of which are the ResNet50 and VGG16
Using Dataset to classify images of apples and tomatoes

Choose the appropriate model!
You must first specify the target of the dataset, Then find the model that is closest to this data, and the closer the data is to the model, the more layers will be frozen, that is, it will not be trained again.
Then there are models that care more about accuracy than speed,on the contrary, care more about speed. 

You can view more models from Keras https://keras.io/api/applications/
